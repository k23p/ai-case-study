# The Use of AI in the QSR Space: A Yum! Brands - Taco Bell Case Study

## Introduction

This case study will dive into AI applications within the Quick Service Restaurant (QSR) space, examining how fast food brand [Taco Bell](https://www.tacobell.com/) has successfully implemented AI into marketing and operations practices to drive improved sales.

## Company Origins

Taco Bell was founded on March 21, 1962 by Glen Bell in Downey, California. The first fast food restaurant chain, McDonalds, had been founded in the same city only nine years earlier.

Initially, Taco Bell started as a small drive-thru called "Taco Tia," but Bell later rebranded it as Taco Bell. The fast food chain became popular for serving Mexican-inspired dishes, such as tacos, burritos, and nachos, at affordable prices. It quickly expanded, and by the late 1960s, Taco Bell had begun franchising its locations.

The company was acquired by PepsiCo in 1978 as a part of PepsiCo’s broader expansion strategy into the fast food space. PepsiCo had already acquired Pizza Hut in 1977, and decided to add Taco Bell to the portfolio – this acquisition fueled Taco Bell’s rapid expansion across the country. Due to the growing operational complexities of running a successful chain of fast food restaurants and franchises, PepsiCo decided to spin off its fast food portfolio, which by that time also included KFC (acquired in 1986). In 1997, the Tricon Global Restaurants Group was created to manage the fast food brands. Tricon later rebranded to Yum! Brands in 2002, and still retains that name today.

## The Issues

As a result of the global pandemic, Taco Bell’s sales had declined ~30%, and the company was looking for ways to increase overall sales to new customers and also to increase frequency of purchase with existing customers.  The organization was searching for a way to recover lost sales and to improve their growth trajectory. Through the work of [Joe Park](https://www.linkedin.com/in/josephrpark/) (Chief Digital and Technology Officer at YumBrands), [Melissa Friebe](https://www.linkedin.com/in/melissafriebe/) (Chief Brand Strategy Officer for Taco Bell) and [Taylor Montgomery](https://www.linkedin.com/in/taylor-montgomery-b5a96947/) (Chief Marketing Officer for Taco Bell North America), the Taco Bell organization decided to incorporate AI into marketing and operations practices in the hopes of improving their topline growth. 

## Business Activities

Taco Bell primarily targets a youthful audience, with a focus on individuals aged 18 to 34. This demographic includes college students, young professionals, and "late-night eaters." These customers value affordability, convenience, and bold flavors. Taco Bell positions itself as an accessible and fun option, appealing to people who seek quick meals with a sense of adventure. The brand also emphasizes its appeal to budget-conscious consumers, making it a go-to choice for those seeking tasty meals without breaking the bank.  

Taco Bell is ranked approximately 4th in Market Share for Total Revenue in the roughly $337.8 billion North American Fast Food Market, behind McDonalds, Chick-Fil-A, and Starbucks. Taco Bell’s global revenue in 2023 was $15Bn, with $11Bn of that coming from the North American market.  In 2019, the average sales per Taco Bell unit in the U.S. were approximately $1.6 million. By 2023, this figure increased to about $2.1 million per unit, indicating a significant rise in unit-level sales.

Taco Bell has been leading the way in testing AI-powered voice ordering in drive-thrus. This includes integrating the AI system with loyalty programs to suggest personalized items based on customer preferences, which can include previous order history or dietary needs. This system is being rolled out across multiple states, allowing the AI to refine its accuracy and efficiency. The goal is to improve order speed and accuracy while addressing staffing challenges, a key concern in the post-pandemic labor market​.

## Solutions They Offer 

According to Joe Park, Yum Brands' Chief Digital and Technology Officer: 
>"Our vision is really to make sure that our franchisees have the best technologies to run their
restaurants. Marketing is certainly used to drive top-line growth, so it’s always been something that we’ve planned
for. The personalized AI-driven marketing is something that’s more recent.  In the pilot, we delivered emails that were customized at an individual level. When we look at factors like the time of day, the day of the week, the subject line in the email, the content, and more, you can optimize that for
marketing use cases like upselling, retention, referrals and
even win-back strategies."

In a recent Wall Street Journal interview, Park stated, 
>"Our goal is to give our consumers better- timed offers, personalized content and tailored interactions so they feel understood and don’t receive generic clutter.  We have pre-written messages and we are using AI to select from them and decide when to deliver them
and how. We use a mix of both internally developed and third-party
AI tools, and we’re finding potential audiences and
customizing their respective offers, and really using
automation to do that.
If you’re a marketeer, traditional AB testing methods are
used—the consumer wants something in red, or is it in
blue, and which one wins? That can be slow and limited in
how we test. What’s different with this pilot is we can move to AI testing, called reinforcement learning. Instead of waiting weeks for test results, we’re seeing real-time
results that we’re continuously fine-tuning."

## Competitive Landscape

[McDonald's](https://www.mcdonalds.com/us/en-us.html) has taken a more extensive approach to AI, focusing on its voice-ordering systems at drive-thrus, which are powered by AI voice bots. These bots are trained to handle orders efficiently, adapting to customer speech patterns and enhancing the customer experience by reducing wait times and improving accuracy

[Chick-fil-A](https://www.chick-fil-a.com/), while also experimenting with AI, has focused on more physical applications such as autonomous robots in certain locations for food delivery and testing AI systems for customer service tasks

Taco Bell seems to be at the forefront of integrating AI into its ordering processes, with a strong focus on personalization and drive-thru efficiency. McDonald's is expanding voice-based AI ordering, and Chick-fil-A is exploring robotics alongside AI to enhance in-store operations. Each brand's strategy reflects their distinct priorities in improving customer service and operational efficiency.

## Results

Taco Bell's use of artificial intelligence (AI) has contributed significantly to its sales performance, particularly by boosting digital engagement. In 2023, Taco Bell experienced a 60% increase in its digital sales, largely driven by the expansion of its AI-powered initiatives. These included improvements to the customer experience, particularly through digital ordering systems, such as mobile apps and kiosks, which helped drive a larger digital sales mix​

Additionally, Taco Bell's Voice AI technology, which is being deployed in U.S. drive-thrus, aims to streamline the ordering process, reduce operational inefficiencies, and improve customer satisfaction. This effort is part of a broader strategy to enhance customer engagement by using AI to personalize interactions and drive loyalty

The integration of these AI systems has contributed to Taco Bell's ability to maintain growth in the competitive fast-food sector, particularly as its digital platforms continue to account for an increasing share of total sales​

## Recommendations

There are quite a few different ways in which Taco Bell can continue to expand their utilization of AI to drive greater revenue and profit.  

* **Marketing Examples**
     * Dynamic Pricing: Taco Bell could implement AI to adjust prices dynamicall based on demand patterns, weather, time of day, or regional preferences. This may help them optimize sales and attract more customers during low-traffic times. For example, AI could adjust pricing for certain menu items to encourage greater traffic during slower hours, using real-time data to maximize revenue per customer. This type of pricing strategy has been successfully employed by other companies in different sectors, increasing their profitability.
   * Social Media Content Optimization: Taco Bell could use AI to analyze customer interactions on social media and identify trending topics, flavor or other preferences, and emerging food trends. In addition, Taco Bell could use AI tools to create and distribute highly targeted content focused on these themes, optimizing their posts and ads to drive maximum audience engagement. This could include automatically generated posts based on popular keywords or user-generated content, leading to increased brand visibility and deeper connections with the target audience.
 * ​**Product Innovation Examples**
     * Product Recommendations: Taco Bell could use AI tools to suggest personalized product pairings or new menu items based on a customer’s preferences or purchase history could increase upselling opportunities. For example, when a customer orders a particular taco or burrito, the AI system could suggest sides or drinks that are frequently bought together, leading to higher average order values. This could be implemented in both drive-thru ordering systems and digital channels like the app or website.
     * Product Development: Taco Bell could use AI to help create new, innovative menu items by analyzing customer preferences and successful past products.

* **Operations Examples**
    * Predictive Analytics for Menu Optimization: Taco Bell could use AI tools to understand consumption patterns, and then use that data to predict predict customer demand for specific items and optimize its menu based on real-time data, trends, and seasonal factors. This would allow Taco Bell to adjust its offerings dynamically, reducing waste, improving the speed of service, and making sure popular items are always in stock.
    * Drive-Thru & Delivery Service Integration: Taco Bell could use AI tools to improve operational efficiency in their drive-thru and delivery services. AI tools could be used to predict high-demand periods and automatically adjust staffing or product availability, ensuring that customer wait times remain low even during peak hours. Additionally, Taco Bell could reduce delivery times by using AI to predict and optimize delivery routes, which would then improve customer satisfaction and the likelihood of repeat orders.
